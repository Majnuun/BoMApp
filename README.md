# BoMApp

Inspired by the 'Book of Mormon Baseball' game, this simple program can be used to quiz yourself on the Book of Mormon. 
The program will give you a random verse, and prompt you to guess the book (case sensitive- 1 Nephi not 1 nephi), followed by the chapter

The end game for this program would be to implement an opinionated teaching system.
    ie, if 1 Nephi 16 is the correct answer but you thought it was Alma, the program should explain the key events/characters of Alma and 1 Nephi
    If you get 1 Nephi, but didn't know the chapter, it should explain that 1 Nephi 16 is associated with key events like: Nephi's bow breaking, Lehi's sons marrying Ishmael's daughter, etc.
    It could also tell you what the key words in the verse were that should point you towards 1 Nephi > Ch. 16


#To Do
  1) Limit guesses. Currently it will tell you how many tries it took you, but will give you unlimited tries
  2) Teaching system
  3) GUI
  4) Add the other standard works
